    "Begin by moving the pulleys to the high position, select the resistance to be used, and take a handle in each hand.",
    "Step forward in front of both pulleys with your arms extended in front of you, bringing your hands together. Your head and chest should be up as you lean forward, while your feet should be staggered. This will be your starting position.",
