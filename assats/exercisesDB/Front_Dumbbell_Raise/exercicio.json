    "Pick a couple of dumbbells and stand with a straight torso and the dumbbells on front of your thighs at arms length with the palms of the hand facing your thighs. This will be your starting position.",
    "While maintaining the torso stationary (no swinging), lift the left dumbbell to the front with a slight bend on the elbow and the palms of the hands always facing down. Continue to go up until you arm is slightly above parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this portion of the movement and pause for a second at the top. Inhale after the second pause.",
    "Now lower the dumbbell back down slowly to the starting position as you simultaneously lift the right dumbbell.",
    "Continue alternating in this fashion until all of the recommended amount of repetitions have been performed for each arm."
