    "While standing straight, hold a barbell plate in both hands at the 3 and 9 o\u0027clock positions. Your palms should be facing each other and your arms should be extended and locked with a slight bend at the elbows and the plate should be down near your waist in front of you as far as you can go. Tip: The arms will remain in this position throughout the exercise. This will be your starting position.",
    "Slowly raise the plate as you exhale until it is a little above shoulder level. Hold the contraction for a second. Tip: make sure that you do not swing the weight or bend at the elbows. Your torso should remain stationary throughout the movement as well.",
    "As you inhale, slowly lower the plate back down to the starting position.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
