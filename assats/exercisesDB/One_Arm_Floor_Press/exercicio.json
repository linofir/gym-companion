    "Lie down on a flat surface with your back pressing against the floor or an exercise mat. Make sure your knees are bent.",
    "Have a partner hand you the bar on one hand. When starting, your arm should be just about fully extended, similar to the starting position of a barbell bench press. However, this time your grip will be neutral (palms facing your torso).",
    "Make sure the hand you are not using to lift the weight is placed by your side.",
    "Begin the exercise by lowering the barbell until your elbow touches the ground. Make sure to breathe in as this is the eccentric (lowering part of the exercise).",
    "Then start lifting the barbell back up to the original starting position. Remember to breathe out during the concentric (lifting part of the exercise).",
    "Repeat until you have performed your recommended repetitions.",
    "Switch arms and repeat the movement."
