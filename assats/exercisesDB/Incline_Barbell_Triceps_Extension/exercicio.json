    "Hold a barbell with an overhand grip (palms down) that is a little closer together than shoulder width.",
    "Lie back on an incline bench set at any angle between 45-75-degrees.",
    "Bring the bar overhead with your arms extended and elbows in. The arms should be in line with the torso above the head. This will be your starting position.",
    "Now lower the bar in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Inhale as you perform this movement. Tip: Keep your upper arms stationary and close to your head at all times. Only the forearms should move.",
    "Return to the starting position as you breathe out and you contract the triceps. Hold the contraction for a second.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
