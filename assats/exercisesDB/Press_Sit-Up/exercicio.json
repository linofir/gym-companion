    "While inhaling, tighten your abdominals and glutes. Simultaneously curl your torso as you do when performing a sit-up and press the barbell to an overhead position while exhaling. Tip: Use your arms to push the barbell out as you perform this exercise while still focusing on the abdominal muscles.",
    "Lower your upper body back down to the starting position while bringing the barbell back down to your torso. Remember to breathe in while lowering the body.",
