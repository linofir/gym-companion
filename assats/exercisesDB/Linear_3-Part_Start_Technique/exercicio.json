    "This drill helps you accelerate as quickly as possible into a sprint from a dead stop. It helps to use a line to start from. Begin with two feet on the line. Place your left foot with the toe next to your right ankle. Place your right foot 4-6 inches behind the left.",
    "Place your right hand onto the line, and thing bring your nose close to your left knee.",
    "Squat down as you lean foward, your head being lower than your hips and your weight loaded onto the left leg. This will be your starting position.",
    "Take your left hand up so that it is parallel to the ground, pointing behind you, and explode out when ready."
